## 🔷 1. INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING

### ❖ Overview
- **Pedagogy** is the method and practice of teaching.
- **Multimedia Pedagogy** involves using technology to create **Interactive Systems** that transform learning from a passive activity (listening to a lecture) to an active one (doing, exploring, solving).
- This section explores how computers and multimedia change the educational landscape.

### ❖ 1. The Shift: Traditional vs. Multimedia Pedagogy

| **Feature** | **Traditional Pedagogy** | **Multimedia Pedagogy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role of Teacher** | "Sage on the Stage" (Lecturer) | "Guide on the Side" (Facilitator) |
| **Role of Student** | Passive Listener | Active Participant |
| **Content Delivery** | Linear (Textbook chapters) | Non-Linear (Hyperlinks, Search) |
| **Pace** | Fixed (Same for everyone) | Self-Paced (Individualized) |
| **Media** | Text and Talk | Text, Audio, Video, Animation, VR |
| **Feedback** | Delayed (Exam results) | Immediate (Quiz scores) |

## 🔷 3. A MEDICAL APPLICATION: MED NET

### ❖ Overview
- **Med Net** (Medical Network) is a conceptual framework for a **Collaborative Medical System**.
- It demonstrates how multimedia and networking can revolutionize healthcare (**Telemedicine**).
- It addresses the problem of **Expertise Distribution**: Specialists are in cities, but patients are everywhere.

---

### ❖ 1. The Problem
- A patient in a rural village has a complex heart condition.
- The local doctor is a General Practitioner (GP), not a Cardiologist.
- Traveling to the city is expensive and dangerous for the sick patient.
- **Solution**: Bring the expert to the patient virtually via **Med Net**.

---

### ❖ 2. Key Features of Med Net

#### **A. Multimedia Patient Records (EMR - Electronic Medical Records)**
- Traditional records are paper-based text.
- **Med Net Records** include:
    - **Text**: Patient history, prescriptions.
    - **Images**: X-rays, CT Scans, MRI, Skin lesion photos.
    - **Audio**: Recorded heartbeat, lung sounds.
    - **Video**: Endoscopy footage, gait analysis (walking pattern).

#### **B. Real-Time Tele-Consultation**
- High-definition video conferencing.
- Allows the specialist to "see" the patient.
- **Remote Examination**: Using connected peripherals (digital stethoscope) so the specialist can hear the heart remotely.

#### **C. Collaborative Diagnosis**
- **Whiteboarding**: The specialist can draw circles on an X-ray image that the local doctor sees instantly.
- **Screen Sharing**: Viewing live test results together.

#### **D. Distributed Database**
- Patient data is not on one computer.
- It is distributed across secure servers but accessible as a single unified record.
- **Redundancy**: Backups ensure data is never lost.

---

### ❖ 3. Technical Standards

#### **A. DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)**
- The global standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging.
- Ensures an X-ray taken on a GE machine can be viewed on a Siemens monitor.

#### **B. HL7 (Health Level 7)**
- Standard for exchanging text-based patient data between different hospital systems.

#### **C. Security & Privacy (HIPAA)**
- Medical data is sensitive.
- **Encryption**: Data must be scrambled during transmission.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized doctors can view records.

---

### ❖ 4. Workflow Scenario
1.  **Data Capture**: Local doctor takes an X-ray and records patient symptoms.
2.  **Upload**: Data is uploaded to the Med Net server via high-speed link.
3.  **Notification**: The Specialist in the city gets an alert.
4.  **Review**: Specialist reviews the high-res X-ray (DICOM).
5.  **Consultation**: Specialist initiates a video call with the local doctor and patient.
6.  **Diagnosis**: Specialist identifies the issue and prescribes treatment.
7.  **Record**: The session and prescription are saved to the patient's EMR.

---

### ❖ 5. Advantages
- **Access to Expertise**: Democratizes healthcare.
