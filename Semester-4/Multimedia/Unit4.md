## 🔷 1. MULTIMEDIA DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

### ❖ Overview
- **Multimedia Development** is the process of creating the individual assets (text, audio, video, graphics) that will be used in a multimedia project.
- **Development Tools** are the specialized software programs used to create, edit, and manipulate these assets.
- Before you can *assemble* a project (Authoring), you must *create* the parts (Development).

## 🔷 4. HYPERTEXT AND HYPERMEDIA

### ❖ Overview
- **Hypertext** is the concept that powers the World Wide Web.
- It breaks the linear constraint of traditional text (start to finish) and allows **Non-Linear** navigation.
- **Hypermedia** expands this to include all media types.

---

### ❖ 1. Definitions

#### **A. Hypertext**
- Text which contains links to other text.
- Coined by **Ted Nelson** in 1963.
- *Example:* Clicking a word in a Wikipedia article to jump to its definition.

#### **B. Hypermedia**
- An extension of hypertext that includes graphics, audio, video, and animation.
- *Example:* A webpage with text, a video player, and a clickable image map.

#### **C. Multimedia**
- Any combination of text, art, sound, animation, and video delivered by computer.
- *Difference*: Multimedia *can* be linear (a movie). Hypermedia *must* be interactive/linked.

---

### ❖ 2. Elements of Hypertext

#### **A. Nodes**
- The fundamental unit of information.
- A node can be a document, a paragraph, an image, or a video clip.
- In the Web context, a **Webpage** is a node.

#### **B. Links (Hyperlinks)**
- The connection between two nodes.
- **Anchor**: The source of the link (usually blue, underlined text).
- **Destination**: The target node.
- **Types**:
    - **Internal**: Link to the same page.
    - **External**: Link to another website.

#### **C. Network**
- The structure formed by the collection of nodes and links.
- Can be simple (linear) or complex (web-like).

---

### ❖ 3. Applications of Hypertext
- **World Wide Web (WWW)**: The largest implementation of hypertext (HTML = HyperText Markup Language).
- **Online Help Systems**: "Click here for troubleshooting" jumps to the relevant section.
