## ⭐ COMPONENTS OF MULTIMEDIA — 10 MARKS

## ❖ Introduction

Multimedia refers to the integration of multiple forms of media such as text, graphics, audio, video and animation, presented to the user through a computer system. Instead of relying on a single form of information, multimedia combines various elements to communicate ideas more powerfully and effectively. Each component plays a unique role, has specific characteristics, and requires particular hardware/software for creation, storage and playback. The success of any multimedia application depends on how well these components are integrated to achieve clarity, engagement and usability.

There are **five major components of multimedia**:

1. Text
2. Graphics (Images)
